*Federated learning* is a decentralized machine learning approach that trains AI models on distributed servers without exchanging raw data. Instead of centralized data collection, devices compute model updates locally. Only the model updates are sent to a central server to improve a global model.

*Decentralized parallel learning* (DPL) aims to overcome the high costs and privacy concerns of centralized AI training. However, this approach faces significant hurdles, primarily driven by the need to synchronize models over slow networks, heterogeneous hardware, and the absence of a central authority.
