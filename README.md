# Distributed AI Training Incentivisation and Discovery Protocol

The Distributed AI Training Incentivisation and Discovery Protocol (DATIDP) is a 
protocol to facilitate permissionless nodes to cooperate in the creation of a 
distributed large language model (LLM). 



## Requirements

The protocol should allow for:

* Discovery of other nodes in the network that hold specific sections of the model.
* Incentivise node operators to uniformly support all parts of the model.
* Discourage model poisoning.
* Discourage a sole operator from owning sections from all parts of the model. Ideally, the protocol will prevent this.
* Identify and fine free loaders.
